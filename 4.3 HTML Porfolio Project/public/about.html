<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Alvee Yesmin Zerin, a 17-year-old student at Ideal College, Dhanmondi, and an enthusiastic beginner in web development. My journey into the world of coding started with a strong curiosity about how websites are built. I’m learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and am particularly interested in making websites that are both easy to use and visually appealing.
</p>

<p>In addition to web development, I enjoy creative activities like writing and painting. These hobbies help me pay close attention to details and think creatively, which I bring into my web design work. I believe that good web design should not only look great but also work well for users, and I strive to balance these elements in my projects.
</p>

<p>As I continue to learn and grow, I’m excited to take on new challenges and work on projects that allow me to use my skills in both technology and creativity. My goal is to create engaging and effective websites that make a positive impact and meet users’ needs.
